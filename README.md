# project-2
this code generates a series of random numbers to simulate population transfer in a two-particle three-level fermionic system. 
This is an extention of project 1, but with one difference.
the interaction between particles (J) is thought to be a function of alpha (magnetic field sweeping rate). this means that the material is a function of external field which is unlikely, but for the sake of study bare with us!
run the code and see the results.
you can also adjust the values for alpha, J and siggnificace of alpha on J manually and see how this works.
Thanks!
